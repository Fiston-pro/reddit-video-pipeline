After 4 years and a wedding, my partner left me for a guy on Discord.
TL;DR: Partner of 4 years (we got married!) emotionally cheated and eventually physically cheated on me with a US Army guy she met online. Found out after months of manipulation, secrecy, and lies. Currently navigating condo/mortgage stuff and moving on.

Oh boy… I need to get this out.

I met my partner—let’s call her M (33)—4 years ago. Red flags were everywhere, but I ignored them thinking I could change her. We met online during the pandemic around November 2021 as FWB. She had just left a previous relationship where her ex cheated on her and stole her money.

Things started well. After three months, we made it official. Three wonderful years followed—or so I thought. We bought a condo together (her mom financed it), got a dog, and built a life. But when we moved in together, M barely helped around the house or with the dog. I handled cooking, cleaning, maintenance, and just… everything. Her excuse? Her parents were wealthy and didn’t need to do chores, so why should she?

M had a rough upbringing—bullied, emotionally abused by her mom, and she coped with childish behaviors: watching Disney, eating comfort foods, bottling up feelings. I encouraged therapy, but she refused. We argued sometimes because of my upbringing (yelling was normal in my household) and her background (parents resolved conflict quietly).

Summer 2023, Her mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer and only had a couple years left. Her wish was to see her daughter get married before she passed. M was very depressed at this time and I did my best to help her and the family. I would make whole meals for the family, call her mom once a week to check on her and how she is doing. Visit her whenever I could and just spent as much time with her.

On the other hand, M bottled this up and didn’t convey much to me during this period but the despicable thing M did and continues to do is not call her or even text her mother. She would avoid visits and seeing her if not necessary to fit her needs. I remember her mom was so angry with her for not contacting her she cried in the car. This is one of many things I will not forgive M for. Her mother supports her for everything and yet when she needed support M wasn’t there for her. Even today, since I’ve moved out she has asked mom for support to feed her, clothe her and take care of the condo situation.

In October 2024, I proposed in Hawaii in front of her family. Everything seemed perfect—but things began to unravel.

From January to April 2025, I took a second job to cover wedding expenses. M felt lonely and isolated, spending most of her time gaming online. She met someone—let’s call him N—through a Discord group. She confided in him about our problems, unknowingly letting him manipulate her emotionally.

April 2025, I return from my bachelor trip. M confesses she’s having cold feet and doesn’t want to go through with the wedding. I ask her if she wants to break up or work on it—she chooses the latter. I adjust my schedule to be more present.

May 2025, I’m handling all wedding planning on top of chores and dog care. M opts out, citing stress from school and work. I arranged a surprise bachelorette weekend for her 10 days before the wedding. She went with my friends who hosted her, and that’s when the cracks widened: she admitted to them she was emotionally involved with N and felt a deeper connection to him.

She comes back, lies about it, and we attempt couples counseling—but she refuses to engage meaningfully. Meanwhile, she continues communicating with N, converting to his Christian community, and keeping secrets: new passwords, private screen protectors, hiding messages.

October 2025, she takes a “solo trip” to Chicago and Arizona. I ask for nightly video calls to ensure she’s safe; she ignores this. Turns out she’s staying with N’s family, spending time with him. By December, she’s distancing herself more, asking to transfer her accounts into her name, and neglecting holidays.

January 2026, fights escalate. I confront her, she flees to her mom’s house, trying to take the dog. By February, we’re separated but still living together. I go on a business trip; when I return, I find lingerie in her luggage—proof of her cheating with N. She’s been planning a future with him, moving to Arizona eventually.

Her mom and friends knew and manipulated the situation to protect their own interests. I’ve decided to move out, reclaim what’s mine, and cut ties. M’s actions reflect her upbringing: her parents cheated to be together, so the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.

Now, I’m sitting here with my dog, starting the healing process, navigating the condo/mortgage situation, and trying to focus on myself.

I did what I could, I’ll continue therapy, and eventually, I’ll be free from all this.
