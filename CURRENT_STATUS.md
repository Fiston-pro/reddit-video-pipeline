## ⚠️ Issue: Python 3.13 Compatibility

Supabase packages don't fully support Python 3.13 yet.

## 🚀 Quick Solutions:

### Option A: Test AI Now (Works!)
```bash
python test_ai_enhancement.py
```

### Option B: Use Python 3.11/3.12
Install Python 3.11, recreate venv, run setup.bat

### Option C: Deploy Dashboard Only

vercel link
vercel --prod
```
